# Deep-Learning---Reviews-Prediction
### Review rating prediction framework using deep learning   
     
This project was made to predict reviews on hotels from the TripAdvisor website.    
We dowloaded the dataSet from the Kaggle website, press [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews) to review it!    
Our goal was to classify the rating into three groups (Low, Mid, High) and predict as much as we could with
the best accuracy and fitting of the test & train errors.   
   
 Here is an image which provides us an understanding of the word distribution from all 20,492 review:

Two methods were used here, the first one is a simple **SoftMax regression**    
The second one is a **Neural Network with two hidden layers** for best results.   
     
    
Hope you enjoy our code!
